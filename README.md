2. fibonacci delay generator
3. random coordinates on a sphere
4. sampling of a strange probability density function
5. marsaglia sampling on a sphere
6. rejection sampling of Gauss and Lorentz function
7. sampling of an experiment curves
8. Monte Carlo integrals
9. central limit theory
10. random walk with a time-harmonic electric field
11. growing self avoiding random walk
12. renormalization group method
13. Metropolis-Hasting sampling 
14. Metropolis-Markov Monte Carlo(MCMC)
